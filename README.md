# OpenCV Pixel Lab

Small lab where I practice **computer vision basics** with Python and OpenCV.  
The goal is to understand what happens at the pixel level instead of only relying on built-in functions.

## What I’m doing
- Loading and inspecting images (size, channels, types)  
- Working with color channels (BGR, RGB, grayscale)  
- Writing simple filters (blur, sharpen, edge detection)  
- Comparing my own code with OpenCV functions  

## Purpose
This repo is my **learning sandbox** — each experiment explains the math idea (convolution, thresholding, etc.) and then shows how OpenCV implements it.
